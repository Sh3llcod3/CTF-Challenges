## Hint

It might be worth investigating the use of [this tool](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/crunch), how to create a custom charset with it and feed it to a program like [`this`](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng).

Alternatively, if you have the system for it, it might be easier to look into how to use [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) with WPA2 passwords.
