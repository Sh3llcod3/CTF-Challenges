## Briefing

We're monitoring a group responsible for controlling a large botnet, which is currently sitting at over 200k active devices.

We know they're exfiltrating data via audio files for some reason, though we're know how they're doing it.
We've captured an outgoing file of interest and attached it, can you find out what's inside?

### Files Required

[`files.zip`](files.zip) has been zipped with a password of `sound`.
