## Briefing

Yesterday, our team was called in a hurry to conduct reconnaissance on a suspected goods smuggling cell.
We've taken shelter in the second floor of a run-down coffee shop.

One of our guys managed to intercept a WPA2 handshake from their WiFi network in their building across the street.

We've attached the files, can you recover the password so we can intercept their communications?

> PS: We've managed to gather part of the password, this should help. We've also learnt that the first character is uppercase.

Password: `x61_VxxcxN`

### Files Required

[`files.zip`](files.zip) has been zipped with a password of `intercept`
