## Briefing

We've got a tough assignment for you.

We recovered a mysterious binary from a computer which we were asked to investigate in a criminal case.

The suspect in question is to be held on trial for various computer related crimes, we've managed to make sense of everything else so far, except this binary. We think it might contain important information which could provide incriminating evidence, but we're not fully sure.

Nonetheless, can you take a look and see what it holds?

### Files Required

[`files.zip`](files.zip) has been zipped with a password of `binary`.
