## Briefing

We have a situation brewing. Last week there was an attack on the prime minister of `<countryA>`. His motorcade was stopped by a road blockade where heavily armed men opened fire. Fortunately, the PM was able to escape but quite a few security personnel and a few ministers did not.

ATLAS, a multi-national Private Military Corporation (PMC) based in `<state>`, `<countryB>`, is our main suspect. We believe they were hired to conduct the hit by the opposition political party.

We flew Agent J to `<state>` to investigate further. He gained access to their building's reception area dressed in a suit acting as a potential client with an appointment. He was able to intercept some wireless network traffic from their corporate wireless network before being escorted out by guards when they realised the bluff.

The network capture is attached below, see if you can recover any important documents which could help us tie ATLAS to the `<countryA>` incident.
