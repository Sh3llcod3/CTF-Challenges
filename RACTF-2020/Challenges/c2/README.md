## Briefing

Do you recall the C2 group exfiltrating data we were tracking last year?

Well, as it turns out, we've managed to corroborate their activities with a known APT group. Their operations span across a wide range of industries, including disrupting SCADA systems and stealing corporate data.

Recently, they've been leaking unreleased tracks from various media groups. A Canadian firm, which suffered a new leak, has requested us to take a look. Over the past few days, our analysts have combed through network data trying to identify which computers or servers may have been compromised and used.
In order to bypass detection from IDS/DLP signatures, we think they're somehow extracting these tracks by hiding them in existing music videos so it blends in with usual traffic. We've attached a video that we believe is going to one of their IP addresses.

Can you take a look?
