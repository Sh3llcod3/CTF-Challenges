## Briefing

We've got a case of industrial espionage, quite an unusual one at that. An international building contractor - Hamilton-Lowe, has written to us that they are having their private client contracts leaked.

After conducting initial incident response, they managed to find a hidden directory on one of their public facing web-servers. However, the strange thing is, instead of having any sensitive documents, it was full of mp3 music files.
This is a serious affair as Hamilton-Lowe constructs facilities for high-profile clients such as the military, which means having building schematics leaked from them could lead to a lapse in national security.

We have attached one of these mp3 files, can you examine it and see if there is any hidden information inside?

### Files Required
