## Hint

Any luck on the capture?

It looks like ATLAS hasn't used proper EAP/RADIUS authentication and they're using WPA2-CCMP-PSK. That to me indicates that they likely don't pay much attention to their wireless network security.
How much do you want to bet they use weak, common credentials too?

> I would advise checking out [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) and trying to decrypt the capture file once you find the right key.

Good luck.
