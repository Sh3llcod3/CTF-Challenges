## Hint

I hear that sometimes the best things in life don't change. That goes for the static strings in a binary as well.

With regards to custom symmetric encryption, it doesn't matter what it is as long as you have ciphertext and key. Any modules which you may have installed when running this program might come in very useful, you never know.
As far as packaging methods go, it might be worth investigating how interpreted source can be turned into a compiled binary, the tools that do so, and how they tend to name their functions when compiling and what original language may have been used in the first place.

Aside from this my tip to you would be to avoid any red herrings and focus on the functions within as often they can yield the greatest clues (though it's important to avoid the builtin ones). Even things which may seem obvious to investigate may be a ploy to throw you off, so don't fall for it agent. Remember you can use any debugger/diassembler you want. A decompiler may help here.

Good luck.
