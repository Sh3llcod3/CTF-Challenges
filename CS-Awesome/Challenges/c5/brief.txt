Agent,

It's PCAP forensics time! Umbrella corporation, a large biotech conglomerate,
has asked us for assistance after their network technicians uncovered strange
communications going from a host to a sketchy domain in their IDS sensor logs.

We examined the packets and didn't find anything contained within them. Needless to say
this pattern of traffic seems strange and could indicate this host has been compromised.
Umbrella has significant competition and hacktivists who are after them, so any loss of
intellectual property could cost them a large amount financially.

We've replayed the traffic and captured it for you, can you examine it and see what's happening?
