Agent,

We've working to take down a firearms smuggling operation who are supplying small arms
to various organised crime groups across the world.

We found their web shop, they're selling all sorts of weapons there. Our intel indicates that
there may be some hidden section to the shop. Something like an admin panel used by the store operators.
We believe attempting to buy a certain combination of items might trigger this. If found, this would
prove to be valuable evidence.

Can you take a look?
