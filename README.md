## CTF-Challenges

This repository contains all the challenges that I have created, organised by the name of the CTF it featured in.
All of the challenges should include a __briefing__, a __hint__ and a __writeup__.

Feel free to use these challenges for practice purposes or in your own CTF if you wish,
I will be happy to answer questions regarding them. For some of them the flags are hardcoded.

Please keep in mind that challenges may need deployment with special instructions or come with additional supporting files.
Some of these files may be zipped & encrypted, the password will be listed along with the challenge in the "README.txt" files.

> You can use most of the briefs as-is, but you may want to reword some of them and add in certain details.

## Disclaimer

The quality of any particular challenge is not guaranteed and the difficulty (although subjective) ranges from easy to quite hard.
Each of the them are intended to have varying point scores associated with them and varies significantly in the subjects covered.
